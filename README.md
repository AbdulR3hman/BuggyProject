	  Subject:

                The project was three parts, to build sensors, the motor and the
                final part was to build the programme using micro-ship to control
                the other three parts.


                The car is meant to go around a track which is followed by a 
                magnetic Field. My programme needed to control other parts
	    To achieve this task.


	 A presentation is included to explain in more details if needed.
